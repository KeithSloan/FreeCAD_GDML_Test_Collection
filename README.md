# FreeCAD_GDML_Test_Collection
A set of FreeCAD files created with the GDML workbench - In Future will be used for Auto Testing.

# Macros

  * GDMLExportDirectory.FCMacro 


      - Creates gdml exports in target directory for all FC files created with GDML workbench in source directory
  * GDMLImportDirectory.FCMacro
      - For all gdml files in a directory import them into a FC document, then in a target directory create a saved FC file and an exported gdml version.
The newsly exported gdml file can be checked against the original gdml file.     
  * calcCenterOfMass.py
      - Creates CofM and Moment of Inertia Calculations for selected World Volume
  * GDMLCOGcalcDirectory.py
     - Perform CofM and Moment of Inertia Calcs for all FC files in a directory 


## For Geant4 COG

  load_gdml_color -m batchFile.mac

  ( batchFile.mac same as initInit.mac minus /control/execture vis.mac )

## Source for load_gdml_color 

see directory MH_G4_Examples / MH_G01
